# QUANTUMSECUREUBUNTU

One of the most hardened, NIST-aligned, FIPS-compliant personal Ubuntu systems in the field. 

Let's go through a comprehensive recap of what's done ✅ and what's left 🔜 to complete this hardened, quantum-secure setup.

✅ DONE: Your Achievements So Far

🔐 Cryptographic Hardening

✅ FIPS 140-2 mode enabled (/proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled == 1)

✅ OpenSSL restricted to FIPS-approved ciphers

✅ TLS 1.3 enforced

✅ Legacy and insecure crypto (e.g., MD5) blocked

✅ liboqs compiled and tested (for post-quantum crypto)

✅ liboqs-integrated OpenSSL (oqs-openssl) used

✅ NGINX compiled against oqs-openssl to provide hybrid classical+quantum-safe TLS

🧱 System Hardening

✅ Ansible DISA STIG applied (DoD-compliant baseline)

✅ PAM hardened for GUI, sudo, and SSH

✅ Google Authenticator TOTP 2FA enforced for:

GUI login ✅

Sudo ✅

SSH (with AuthenticationMethods publickey,keyboard-interactive) ✅

✅ PasswordAuthentication disabled in SSH

✅ Strong SSH KEX, MACs, ciphers configured (NIST/FIPS-approved)

✅ Root SSH login disabled

✅ Rate limiting, login grace time, max auth tries enforced

📚 System Integrity + Verification

✅ 2FA verified at GUI and CLI

✅ OpenSSL errors on MD5 confirm FIPS crypto enforced

✅ pamtester confirms PAM stack working with TOTP

✅ Manual PAM config complete (/etc/pam.d/sudo, sshd, etc.)

🔜 NEXT STEPS: Finalizing the Hardened Quantum-Secure Ubuntu System

🔒 1. Quantum-Secure Disk Encryption

Use LUKS2 with AES-XTS-256 (FIPS-approved) or prepare to test liboqs+dm-crypt prototype for PQ disk encryption.

Enable discard carefully, if using SSD (TRIM).

Optionally combine with TPM2-bound LUKS unlocking (still enforce passphrase).

🧱 2. Boot & Physical Security Hardening

Set BIOS/UEFI password

Disable booting from USB/CD unless explicitly needed

Enable Secure Boot

Add GRUB password to prevent tampering with kernel args (e.g., bypassing FIPS or single-user recovery)

Restrict recovery mode (single boot) with password (GRUB/user lock)

🔥 3. Firewall & Network Defense

Set up UFW or nftables:

Deny all inbound by default

Allow only SSH/HTTPS (if needed)

Rate limit SSH (fail2ban or sshd settings)

Audit open ports with ss -tuln or nmap

📊 4. Auditing, Logging, & Compliance

Install and configure:

auditd – system audit logs

rsyslog / journald hardened settings

Log forwarding if applicable

Use aide or tripwire for file integrity monitoring

🧾 5. Backup Configs and Create Audit Trail

Back up all:

/etc/pam.d/*

/etc/ssh/sshd_config*

/etc/issue.net

/etc/ufw/ufw.conf or nftables.conf

~/.google_authenticator

Keep a Git or encrypted log of config changes and security events

🔐 Optional Advanced Hardening

Feature

Description

🧩 AppArmor or SELinux

Lock down services and system daemons

🕵️‍♂️ Tor/i2p firewall rules

Block anonymizers at network level

📉 Kernel tuning

Disable IPv6 (if unused), ICMP flood limits, SYN cookies

💽 Read-only /boot

Protect kernel and initramfs from tampering

📦 Final Output: What You'll Have

A bare-metal, FIPS 140-2 compliant, DISA STIG-hardened, quantum-resistant, 2FA-protected, and network-fortified Ubuntu 22.04 system — ready for high-security operations or compliance-critical deployments.

Developed in collaboration with ChatGPT (OpenAI), the Ubuntu Security Team, DISA STIG, liboqs (Open Quantum Safe), and best practices from NIST SP 800-series.
